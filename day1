Hi welcome dude.

As of today (01.06.22), I am starting with this post to create the first link in a series of "don't break the chain", which I call "Wisdom Path". 
Experience, inference, opinion on a daily subject in order to make my learning continuous and permanent.
and the name I gave to compiling and sharing my information as output.
My purpose is to make my production regular and to create a small pool, even if there is no lake, drip by drop :) (look: "Drop By Drop Becomes A Lake" proverb)

Befitting the first ring, today I will share an important tip on the subject of "Learning to Learn", 
which is the basic building block of a conscious life, which will be useful in every field and at all times.

Abstract: In order to reach the information accurately and faster, reach the source of the information as much as possible and follow it up. 
You can look source (+references) in the books, tutorial, video and other info source materials. 

Let me give a quick recommendation for the content that is not given a bibliography.

 *If it is an image, google, yandex, tineye et al.  You can use the site and additional tools that do "reverse image search".  
 (For a more advanced level, you can review the "image analyze tools".)

 *Text, on the other hand, lists suitable results if it matches when you search for a part of it with popular search engines.  
 Another issue here is to use the search engine's time filter correctly.

 *For video and audio files, my advice is to search archive sites and search engines in the form of appropriate titles that can be uploaded to the internet.  
 For a little more advanced, you can find more information with the video analyzer site or software and make more appropriate searches.


  P.S: I expect constructive criticism and suggestions from you in this process for my development.  Also, it would be great to add on the subject :)
